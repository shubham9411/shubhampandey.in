In the college the holidays are the most important time not to be wasted. So <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">I</span> decided to join an internship and <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">yeah, I</span> joined <a href="http://coloredcow.com" target="_blank">ColoredCow</a>, a startup company from our college senior. My friends and family asked me about why you <span id="GingerWidget-correction-2" class="correction alternate">are going</span> to do an internship, you can enjoy your holidays. <span id="GingerWidget-correction-3" class="correction alternate">Yeah, it</span> is a valid question why <span id="GingerWidget-correction-4" class="correction alternate">I</span> choose an internship, so <span id="GingerWidget-correction-5" class="correction alternate">I</span> come up with some points of my own <span id="GingerWidget-correction-6" class="correction alternate">that&#8217;s</span> why <span id="GingerWidget-correction-7" class="correction alternate">I</span> do an internship.

**Apply the Rules**

How big a university is but it just limited to the Course. So where you going to apply all those principles and rules. Till we <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">don&#8217;t apply</span> the same to the real world we cannot understand it well and not know where it going to be used. So, if you join an <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">internship, you</span> can sum up your knowledge to the real world.

**Explore the Industry**

As an <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">intern, you</span> are going to be a part of the industry, so you can know how the industry works and what happen outside the college world. You can discover what you like to do and what you don&#8217;t.

**Gain Experience**

Working in an internship is like knowing about yourself and meeting many people knowing about your passions. As working on different projects you can know what you are passionate about and you can make plans about what you are going to do.

**Increase your Network**

You meet many people out there so that you can increase your network as well. You can learn from the past experiences, mistakes, etc. so that you can learn many things.

During your internship, you can develop your confidence, habits and decide what you are good at.
