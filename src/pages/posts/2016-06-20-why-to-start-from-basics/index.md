When <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">I</span> <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">started</span> working on the project we are given <span id="GingerWidget-correction-2" class="correction alternate">IÂ </span>started the project from creating the Repository on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" target="_blank">GIT</a>, installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/download" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and pushed all the data in directory of <span id="GingerWidget-correction-3" class="correction alternate">WordPress</span> to the repository <span id="GingerWidget-correction-4" class="correction alternate">(</span>including the config. file with <span id="GingerWidget-correction-5" class="correction alternate">the passwords</span> of database). Then in our code <span id="GingerWidget-correction-6" class="correction alternate">review, we</span> find out that we are <span id="GingerWidget-correction-7" class="correction alternate">wrong, weÂ </span>just <span id="GingerWidget-correction-8" class="correction alternate">uploaded all the</span> core files and with passwords along with it. And thenÂ <span id="GingerWidget-correction-9" class="correction alternate">I</span> created a new repository and now <span id="GingerWidget-correction-10" class="correction alternate">I</span> added aÂ <span id="GingerWidget-correction-11" class="correction alternate">.</span><span id="GingerWidget-correction-12" class="correction alternate">Gitignore</span> to ignore some files ofÂ <span id="GingerWidget-correction-13" class="correction alternate">WordPress</span> like config file so <span id="GingerWidget-correction-14" class="correction alternate">I</span> <span id="GingerWidget-correction-15" class="correction alternate">thought</span> now <span id="GingerWidget-correction-16" class="correction alternate">I</span> am in the right direction.
  
As <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">I</span> <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">didn&#8217;t search</span> about the basic that <span id="GingerWidget-correction-2" class="correction alternate">way</span> to addÂ <span id="GingerWidget-correction-3" class="correction alternate">WordPress</span> git integration and how the only public file can be there in <span id="GingerWidget-correction-4" class="correction alternate">repository</span>Â <span id="GingerWidget-correction-5" class="correction alternate">So</span> <span id="GingerWidget-correction-6" class="correction alternate">I</span> am just in <span id="GingerWidget-correction-7" class="correction alternate">the wrong direction</span> again.Â Now we discussed about it with Vaibhav that how the Integration works then he told us that why we need the core files on the GIT they can be configured by the another contributor so why? then we got to know about the Composer that this is the thing we are missing we have to create a composer installation file that can configure all the WordPress files and we need to take care of just the public ones.

We can install <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">WordPress</span> on the remote server by <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">composer</a>. This is <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">happening</span> because we don&#8217;t know the basics. If we know why to integrate the <span id="GingerWidget-correction-2" class="correction alternate">WordPressÂ </span>and the How so that our details not be shared like our first repository. And next on we added <span id="GingerWidget-correction-3" class="correction alternate">PHP</span> codes on the files to get access to the <span id="GingerWidget-correction-4" class="correction alternate">files, etc.</span> in WordPress <span id="GingerWidget-correction-5" class="correction alternate">(Â </span><span id="GingerWidget-correction-6" class="correction alternate">ðŸ˜›</span>Â ) means if we are working in the <span id="GingerWidget-correction-7" class="correction alternate">WordPress</span> then why we used the PHP because we don&#8217;t know what the basic approach is to have there in a random project. So start from basics to get into it.
