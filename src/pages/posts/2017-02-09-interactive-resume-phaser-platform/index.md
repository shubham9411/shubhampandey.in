When I first saw the website created by <a href="http://prateeknarang.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prateek Narang</a> for his Resume Purpose. I just got an expression like:

> &#8220;_WOW, What a good way of describing your résumé if you are a Web Developer&#8221;._

As usual I am surfing Internet and one of my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nitin.kshatriya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitin</a> came to my room and just opened a new tab in Chrome and opened the Website. Nitin is like just see what I am going to show you, you&#8217;ll be inspired. The website site title is &#8220;_Interactive Resume of Prateek Narang&#8221;. _And then an animation shown up in the browser of Prateek with a parachute.

The content get loaded and hence the game started. The Mario got changed with Prateek&#8217;s Cartoon and i started playing the game. At that time I don&#8217;t know who is that guy. But after playing the Game I know about Prateek, his achievements, awards etc.

So after seeing that Resume I get inspired to make an assets like this in my portfolio. So I researched about it. And I found his <a href="https://github.com/prateek27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github link</a>. There in his profile I have found the repo. for his Interactive Resume in website. From where I got to know about the Phaser.

Phaser is an open source game framework for making desktop and mobile browser HTML5 compatible games. It is based on JavaScript. There is a lot of <a href="http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documentation</a> and <a href="http://phaser.io/examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Examples</a> available in their <a href="http://phaser.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a> as well as in the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github repo</a>.

Till Now I have just tweaked a game that is in the <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a>. I have added a baddie and Diamonds with health and Medicine. But still

> There are miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.
