> No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn&#8217;t trying&#8230;.

&nbsp;

> Code can always be better, perfection is a myth, be self-critical of your code, learn from your mistakes, code something up several ways and evaluate the merits of each design.

&nbsp;

> Take initiative. Your hands will shake. Your throat will go dry. Your eyes would water up but the feeling you get after taking the initiative will be worth it all.

&nbsp;

> It compares where you end up if you improves by 1% every day for a year instead of going worse by 1% every day for a year.
