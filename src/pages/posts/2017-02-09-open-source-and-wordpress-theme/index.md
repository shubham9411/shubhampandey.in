In earlier three-four months me and my friends were trying to work in Open Source and contribute on <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">Open Source</a> Projects. We have researched lots of projects like Chromium, Apache, Atom etc but these are way above our understanding for coding. The High level libraries of C++ and Python etc are too heavy for us.

Meanwhile I am also working on WordPress Themes. I usually never think about the good practices for what I am doing. But I wanted to create a Theme that follow all the Good Practices and Standards for WordPress Theme.Â I have done a 2 weeks long research on this &#8220;How to create Best WordPress Themes&#8221; ðŸ˜› . And if I will create a theme which looks Professional and easily Customizable then how will I reach the ones who needs the Theme.

So now I mixed both of the things together. I have decided that I will Create my theme for uploading in the <a href="http://WordPress.org" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>. WordPress needs all the uploaded theme should have the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank">GPL Licence</a> means literally Open Sourcing your theme.

I know, Simply saying that I will upload it into WordPress is not an easy task. There is a full procedure of Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts on creating and uploading themes. There is a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/about/members/" target="_blank">team</a> who reviews all themes before going live for Millions of Peoples. And as all the theme <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/about/members/" target="_blank">reviewers</a> are volunteers they also have their own work so normally a theme have to wait for around 5 Months(On average) before getting assigned a Reviewer. If your theme is having more than 5 errors then maybe your assigned ticket will be closedÂ just after Assigning the volunteer.

Now if I want my theme get listed on the WordPress I&#8217;ll have to use the <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/best-practices/" target="_blank">Best Practices </a>and all the Theme Standards before Uploading. So from today my new journey is started with my New WordPress Theme. Wish me All the Best ðŸ˜‰
