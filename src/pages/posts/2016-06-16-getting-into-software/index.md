The 1st chapter of <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">the book Code</span> Complete is What is Software construction, so what&#8217;s the term software construction means. Before it we have to understand what is a Construction. A Construction is a process of building, creating stuff. It is like planning, designing an <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">architecture, creating</span> something. As the many processes were used in the process of Construction so that in Software Construction.
  
Now the word software construction. It&#8217;s a process of Developing a Software within many phases. They <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">include</span> many steps like Problem definition, Requirement <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">development, etc.</span> This is what we have to do <span id="GingerWidget-correction-2" class="correction alternate">with</span> our first task of developing a website for Hiring but we did it in <span id="GingerWidget-correction-3" class="correction alternate">different ways</span> like we actually work on the whole part of the problem setup a server on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free" target="_blank">AWS</a> and installed WordPress and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GIT</a> on it and started the server and then we think what to do next and then we go to the Requirement phase and gathered some of the <span id="GingerWidget-correction-4" class="correction alternate">requirements</span>.

But actually it <span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">has</span> to <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">be</span> like first gather information about it how we create the website and mainly what is the requirement of the user here and then we have to go to the design and construction phase. But in the discussion with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateeknarang" target="_blank">Prateek</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishanthkd" target="_blank">KD </a>I realized that we just did it in the reverse way. It is not going to happen like this.

The coding or testing phase <span id="GingerWidget-correction-2" class="correction alternate">is</span> just the 10% of the Software Development process and <span id="GingerWidget-correction-3" class="correction alternate">another</span> 90% is the information gathering and designing phases etc. They just related the whole part to the _"Stone Soup" _<span id="GingerWidget-correction-0" class="correction alternate">that&#8217;s</span> how soldiers in the story feed themselves. Soldiers just created curiosity in the customers and make it happen. Soldiers <span id="GingerWidget-correction-1" class="correction alternate">found things</span> in the <span id="GingerWidget-correction-2" class="correction alternate">installment, but </span>got a good product to be <span id="GingerWidget-correction-3" class="correction alternate">shown</span>. So apart from this the story tells that "Keep adding up smalls to create something large" do it in the parts.

Want something more on _"[Stone Soup][1]"_ my friend wrote an awesome [blog][1] about it.
