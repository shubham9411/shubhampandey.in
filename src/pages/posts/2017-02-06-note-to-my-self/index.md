> Do not try to perfect things, let the time make it perfect for you.

#### Short Notes :

Being productive is comes from inside. You can make time for your work but if you start to say NO to the things that takes your time unnecessary. Be it Counter strike, Be it gossiping.

If you find any time that you are free work on your Blogging, Academics things or start reading a new book. For academics I want to say that don&#8217;t work on the last day of submission you have lot of time don&#8217;t spend it on the internet shitty things. I know many things are important as well going out with friends or going for a walk to primary school etc.

Just maintain the Red Line in between them. And The most important thing is to don&#8217;t habitual of any wrong shitty things you were in the past. Make your future a more interesting then yesterday.

If you are working on a new technology first try to find out any book related to it and read from the book. If you stuck anywhere then take help of the internet.

The focus in this semester for languages will be in WordPress and the one w&#8217;ll have on the Syllabus.

I love coding but i am separated right now. I am not in my coding pants. I have to add it up to my life in Weekends, and work solely on it.

Schedule the work that don&#8217;t do more on WordPress that it will become the sole thing and work on the other things too. But in between there is a red line that says to &#8220;Go away it&#8217;s time to Work on my C++ thing.&#8221;

For any thing that you are developing first create a Document on it and do all the trivia there.

I am not a direct write on screen person you can write all the points on the hard copy then do it on the screen.
